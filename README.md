# Weather App


This was a unique take on a weather app. I used google maps API so you're able to point to anywhere on the map and get The temperature and a host of other data.

I utilised 4 different API calls for the various information.

OpenWeatherAPI
WorldTimeApi
Sunrisesunset.io

And of course google maps API.

The information is collated and displayed an a iPhone UI interface. I have used custom weather symbols and I've also added a switch statement to use specific background images based on
what the weather is and also if it's night or day.
