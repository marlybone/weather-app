# Weather App

This weather app uses the Google Maps API to let you point to anywhere on the map and get the temperature and a host of other data. It utilizes 4 different API calls to gather the information:

OpenWeatherAPI
WorldTimeApi
Sunrisesunset.io
Google Maps API
The information is then collated and displayed in an iPhone UI interface. Custom weather symbols are used, and a switch statement is used to select specific background images based on the weather and time of day.
